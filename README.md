Important steps for git workflow
1. initiailize repo with git init
2. change some shit!
3. check status with git status
4. stage changes for commit
5. commit changes to version history
6. view with git log
#git psyched

Also, now, I'm editing this from the browser to simulate working on a team, and someone pushed changes to the remote repo (origin) from elsewhere, so I'll have to pull those commits to my local repo so that I have the full project before committing anything else.
